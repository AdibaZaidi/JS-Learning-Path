# JS-Learning-Path
This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning JavaScript from scratch to advanced concepts. It contains hands-on practice with syntax, ES6+ features, DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and small projects to apply concepts in real-world use cases.

**What’s inside:**
✅ Basics of JavaScript (variables, loops, functions, arrays, objects, etc.)
✅ ES6+ features (arrow functions, promises, async/await, spread/rest operators, etc.)
✅ DOM manipulation & events
✅ JavaScript projects (mini utilities, apps, and experiments)
✅ Notes & code snippets for quick reference

**Goal:**
To build a strong foundation in JavaScript and prepare for diving into frameworks like React and backend with Node.js.
