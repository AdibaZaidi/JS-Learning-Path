# String Concatenation in JavaScript  

Concatenation means **joining strings together**.  

---

## Example: Using `+` Operator
```js
let firstName = "Adiba";
let lastName = "Zaidi";

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
console.log(fullName);
```
## Example: Adding Strings with Numbers
```js
let age = 23;
console.log("My age is " + age); // My age is 23
```
⚠️ If you use + with a string and number, JavaScript converts the number into a string.
